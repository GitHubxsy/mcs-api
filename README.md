# Multi-cluster Service APIs

This repository hosts the Multi-Cluster Service APIs. Providers can import packages in this repo to ensure their multi-cluster service controller implementations will be compatible with MCS data planes.

This repo contains the initial implementation according to [KEP-1645][kep] and will
be used for iterative development as we work to meet our Alpha -> Beta
[graduation requirements][grad-reqs].
